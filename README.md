Only human 
Only Human is a text game python horror visual novel video game developed by Prince Felonia. 
The gameplay revolves around the player in a diurnal lockdown during a solar catastrophe that caused humans to become nocturnally active.
Nightly, the player must interview others who show up at their door seeking shelter. The player must determine if the interviewee is a human or a hostile "Visitor" during this interaction. If they are allowed inside the player's house, it is possible to further examine them. New ways to discern a Visitor from humans are told to the player daily. Depending on the player's actions during the game, such as killing other humans, different endings will be incurred.

The game takes place in a world where solar activity is dramatically increasing, triggering catastrophic global warming. The player takes on the role of an unnamed male protagonist who lives in a house on the outskirts of a town.
 Every night, people knock on the door asking for shelter from the daytime heat, and the player must decide whether to allow them inside. 
The player must shelter at least one human guest to avoid being overwhelmed and killed by the predatory "Visitors", hostile beings who have begun appearing from underground and mimic humans.


Although, the game isn't finish due the lack of coding by prince's felonia members.


Controls/Tutorial:
There's no tutorial and it was made to solve it on your own. The control system of Only Human was designed to read ands it's decision making game.
There is no formal tutorial, as the game was built on the idea that discovery should feel natural, uncertain, and unassisted. Players are meant to learn the flow of questioning, decision-making, and interaction entirely on their own and story wise.

(the lore of the game, was on the beginning of the story!!!)

This approach was based on the concept that the protagonist himself receives no guidance in his world; therefore, the player should experience the same lack of instruction. The absence of a tutorial reflects the harsh reality of the setting—no one explains how to survive, and no one prepares you for what waits behind the door each night.
